# Twitter Not Interested

Are you frustrated with the endless stream of irrelevant posts cluttering your Twitter timeline? Do you find yourself wishing there was a quicker way to get rid of the nonsense and see only the content that matters to you? This Chrome extension is designed to simplify the process of marking tweets as "Not Interested" and "This post isn't relevant", to ensure they don't clog up your feed.

## Why This Extension?

Twitter's interface requires you to click three times to mark a tweet as "Not Interested" and further indicate that "This post isn’t relevant." This is not only time-consuming but also incredibly frustrating when you just want to doomscroll on twitter. With this extension, you can do all that with a single click, saving you time and reducing frustration.


## Features
- Adds a "Not Interested" button next to each tweet.
- Automatically clicks "Not interested in this" and "This post isn’t relevant" options.
- Simplifies the process from three clicks to just one.
