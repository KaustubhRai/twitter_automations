# Twitter Not Interested

I got frustrated with the endless stream of irrelevant posts cluttering my Twitter timeline. I wanted a quicker way to get rid of the nonsense so I made those 3 clicks into a single click with this extension. Its designed to simplify the process of marking tweets as "Not Interested" and "This post isn't relevant", to ensure they don't clog up your feed.

## Why This Extension?

Twitter's interface requires you to click three times to mark a tweet as "Not Interested" and further indicate that "This post isn’t relevant." This is not only time-consuming but also incredibly frustrating when you just want to doomscroll on twitter. With this extension, you can do all that with a single click, saving you time and reducing frustration.


## Features
- Adds a "Not Interested" button next to each tweet.
- Automatically clicks "Not interested in this" and "This post isn’t relevant" options.
- Simplifies the process from three clicks to just one.
